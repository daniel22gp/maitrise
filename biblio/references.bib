  abstract = {A semantics of temporal categories in language and a theory of their use in defining the temporal relations between events both require a more complex structure on the domain underlying the meaning representations than is commonly assumed. This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a "nucleus." A nucleus can be thought of as an association of a goal event, or "culmination," with a "preparatory process" by which it is accomplished, and a "consequent state," which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for natural-language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.},

In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole.},

Our results suggest that, at least in this domain, metrics may provide a useful measure of language quality, although the evidence for this is not as strong as we would ideally like to see; however, they do not provide a useful measure of content quality.

Two claims made here are that the current representation handles many distinctions (or "divergences") across languages without recourse to language-specific rules and that the lexical-semantic framework provides the basis for a systematic mapping between the interlingua and the syntactic structure. The representation adopted is an extended version of "lexical conceptual structure" which is suitable to the task of translating between divergent structures for two reasons: (1) it provides an abstraction of language-independent properties from structural idiosyncrasies; and (2) it is compositional in nature. The lexical-semantic approach ad- dresses the divergence problem by using a linguistically grounded mapping that has access to parameter settings in the lexicon. We will examine a number of relevant issues including the problem of defining primitives, the issue of interlinguality, the cross-linguistic cover- age of the system, and the mapping between the syntactic structure and the interlingua. A detailed example of lexical-semantic composition will be presented.},

However, creating lexical resources that accurately capture semantic representations en masse is a persistent problem. Where the sheer amount of content makes hand creation inefficient, computerized approaches often suffer from over generality and difficulty with sense disambiguation. This paper describes a semi-automatic method to create verb semantic frames in the Cyc ontology by converting the information contained in VerbNet into a Cyc usable format. This method captures the differences in meaning between types of verbs, and uses existing connections between WordNet, VerbNet, and Cyc to specify distinctions between individual verbs when available.

  abstract = {The VerbNet lexical resource classifies English verbs based on semantic and syntactic regularities and has been used for numerous NLP tasks, most notably, semantic role labeling. Since, in addition to thematic roles, it also provides semantic predicates, it can serve as a foundation for further inferencing. Many verbs belong to multiple VerbNet classes, with each class membership corresponding roughly to a different sense of the verb. A VerbNet token classifier is essential for current applications using the resource and could provide the basis for a deep semantic parsing system, one that made full use of VerbNet's extensive syntactic and semantic information. We describe our VerbNet classifier, which uses rich syntactic and semantic features to label verb instances with their appropriate VerbNet class. It achieves an accuracy of 88.67\% with multiclass verbs, which is a 49\% error reduction over the most frequent class baseline.},

Our approach maps lexical entries in a large LCS-based repository of semantically classified verbs to their corresponding syntactic patterns. A by-product of this mapping is a lexicon that is directly usable in the Minipar system. We evaluate the accuracy and coverage of this lexicon using LDOCE syntactic codes as a gold standard. We show that this lexicon is comparable to the hand-generated Minipar lexicon (i.e., similar recall and precision values). In a later experiment, we automate the process of mapping between the LCS-based repository and syntactic patterns. The advantage of automating the process is that the same technique can be applied directly to lexicons we have for other languages, for example, Arabic, Chinese, and Spanish. 1.},

We evaluate the algorithm in both in-domain and corpus adaptation scenarios. In both cases, we use the manually tagged Semlink WSJ corpus as training data. For indomain (testing on Semlink WSJ data), we achieve 95.9\% accuracy, 35.1\% error reduction (ER) over a strong baseline. For adaptation, we test on the GENIA corpus and achieve 72.4\% accuracy with 10.7\% ER. This is the first large-scale experimentation with automatic algorithms for this task.},

  abstract = {Data-to-text generation systems tend to be knowledge-based and manually built, which limits their reusability and makes them time and cost-intensive to create and maintain. Methods for automating (part of) the system building process exist, but do such methods risk a loss in output quality? In this paper, we investigate the cost/quality trade-off in generation system building. We compare four new data-to-text systems which were created by predominantly automatic techniques against six existing systems for the same domain which were created by predominantly manual techniques. We evaluate the ten systems using intrinsic automatic metrics and human quality ratings. We find that increasing the degree to which system building is automated does not necessarily result in a reduction in output quality. We find furthermore that standard automatic evaluation metrics underestimate the quality of handcrafted systems and over-estimate the quality of automatically created systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents preliminary results of the Brazilian Portuguese Verbnet (VerbNet.Br). This resource is being built by using other existing Computational Lexical Resources via a semi-automatic method. We identified, automatically, 5688 verbs as candidate members of VerbNet.Br, which are distributed in 257 classes inherited from VerbNet. These preliminary results give us some directions of future work and, since the results were automatically generated, a manual revision of the complete resource is highly desirable.},

@article{BussoItalianVerbNetConstructionbased,
  title = {Italian {{VerbNet}}: {{A Construction}}-Based {{Approach}} to {{Italian Verb Classification}}},
  abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for Italian verb classification -and a preliminary example of resulting classes- inspired by Levin (1993) and VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), yet partially independent from these resources; we achieved such a result by integrating Levin and VerbNet's models of classification with other theoretic frameworks and resources. The classification is rooted in the constructionist framework (Goldberg, 1995; 2006) and is distribution-based. It is also semantically characterized by a link to FrameNet'ssemanticframesto represent the event expressed by a class. However, the new Italian classes maintain the hierarchic ``tree'' structure and monotonic nature of VerbNet's classes, and, where possible, the original names (e.g.: Verbs of Killing, Verbs of Putting, etc.). We therefore propose here a taxonomy compatible with VerbNet but at the same time adapted to Italian syntax and semantics. It also addresses a number of problems intrinsic to the original classifications, such as the role of argument alternations, here regarded simply as epiphenomena, consistently with the constructionist approach.},
