  title = {Generating {{A Parsing Lexicon}} from an {{LCS}}-{{Based Lexicon}}},
  abstract = {This paper describes a technique for generating parsing lexicons for a principle-based parser (Minipar). Our approach mapslexical entries in a large LCS-based repository of semantically classified verbs to their corresponding syntactic patterns.A by-product of this mapping is a lexicon that is directly usable in the Minipar system. We evaluate the accuracy andcoverage of this lexicon using LDOCE syntactic codes as a gold standard. We show that this lexicon is comparable to thehand-generated Minipar lexicon (i.e., similar recall and precision values). In a later experiment, we automate the processof mapping between the LCS-based repository and syntactic patterns. The advantage of automating the process is that thesame technique can be applied directly to lexicons we have for other languages, for example, Arabic, Chinese, and Spanish.},

  abstract = {A semantics of temporal categories in language and a theory of their use in defining the temporal relations between events both require a more complex structure on the domain underlying the meaning representations than is commonly assumed. This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a "nucleus." A nucleus can be thought of as an association of a goal event, or "culmination," with a "preparatory process" by which it is accomplished, and a "consequent state," which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for natural-language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.},

In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole.},

Two claims made here are that the current representation handles many distinctions (or "divergences") across languages without recourse to language-specific rules and that the lexical-semantic framework provides the basis for a systematic mapping between the interlingua and the syntactic structure. The representation adopted is an extended version of "lexical conceptual structure" which is suitable to the task of translating between divergent structures for two reasons: (1) it provides an abstraction of language-independent properties from structural idiosyncrasies; and (2) it is compositional in nature. The lexical-semantic approach ad- dresses the divergence problem by using a linguistically grounded mapping that has access to parameter settings in the lexicon. We will examine a number of relevant issues including the problem of defining primitives, the issue of interlinguality, the cross-linguistic cover- age of the system, and the mapping between the syntactic structure and the interlingua. A detailed example of lexical-semantic composition will be presented.},

  abstract = {A robust dictionary of semantic frames is an essential element of natural language understanding systems that use ontologies. However, creating lexical resources that accurately capture semantic representations en masse is a persistent problem. Where the sheer amount of content makes hand creation inefficient, computerized approaches often suffer from over generality and difficulty with sense disambiguation. This paper describes a semi-automatic method to create verb semantic frames in the Cyc ontology by converting the information contained in VerbNet into a Cyc usable format. This method captures the differences in meaning between types of verbs, and uses existing connections between WordNet, VerbNet, and Cyc to specify distinctions between individual verbs when available. This method provides 27,909 frames to OpenCyc which currently has none and can be used to extend ResearchCyc as well. We show that these frames lead to a 20\% increase in sample sentences parsed over the Research Cyc verb lexicon.},

We believe that semantic processing is required for accurate information retrieval.This paper describes a framework for the automatic creation of semantic markup and its insertion into XML documents. The availability of such semantic annotation would be of great help when the documents are queried, and, in particular, would facilitate the application of inference techniques, therefore allowing the system to deduce information not explicitly mentioned in the text.},

  title = {{{VerbNet Class Assignment As}} a {{WSD Task}}},
  abstract = {The VerbNet lexical resource classifies English verbs based on semantic and syntactic regularities and has been used for numerous NLP tasks, most notably, semantic role labeling. Since, in addition to thematic roles, it also provides semantic predicates, it can serve as a foundation for further inferencing. Many verbs belong to multiple VerbNet classes, with each class membership corresponding roughly to a different sense of the verb. A VerbNet token classifier is essential for current applications using the resource and could provide the basis for a deep semantic parsing system, one that made full use of VerbNet's extensive syntactic and semantic information. We describe our VerbNet classifier, which uses rich syntactic and semantic features to label verb instances with their appropriate VerbNet class. It achieves an accuracy of 88.67\% with multiclass verbs, which is a 49\% error reduction over the most frequent class baseline.},

  abstract = {We introduce a large computational subcategorization lexicon which includes subcategorization frame (SCF) and frequency information for 6,397 English verbs. This extensive lexicon was acquired automatically from five corpora and the Web using the current version of the comprehensive subcategorization acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997). The lexicon is provided freely for research use, along with a script which can be used to filter and build sub-lexicons suited for different natural language processing (NLP) purposes. Documentation is also provided which explains each sub-lexicon option and evaluates its accuracy. 1.},

We applied the system to a large newspaper corpus (consisting of 10 years of the French newspaper 'Le Monde') and acquired subcategorization information for 3267 verbs. The system learned 286 SCF types for these verbs. From the analysis of 25 representative verbs, we obtained 0.82 precision, 0.59 recall and 0.69 F-measure. These results are comparable with those reported in recent related work.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the semantic network of English verbs in WordNet. The semantic relations used to build networks of nouns and adjectives cannot be applied without modification, but have to be adapted to fit the semantics of verbs, which differ substantially from those of the other lexical categories. The nature of these relations is discussed, as is their distribution throughout different semantic groups of verbs, which determines certain idiosyneratic patterns of lexicalization. In addition, four variants of lexical entailment are distinguished, which interact in systematic ways with the semantic relations. Finally, the lexical properties of the different verb groups are outlined.},
